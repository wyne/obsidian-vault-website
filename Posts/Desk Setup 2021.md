# Desk Setup 2021

**UPLIFT Standing Desk**

title: "UPLIFT Standing Desk (V2 & V2-Commercial)"

```

This desk has programmable memory height adjustments and is  much sturdier than I expected with the C frame.

**Grovemade Wood Desk Shelf**

```

This matches the Uplift walnut perfectly. The shelf fits a 13” Macbook Pro/Air perfectly (even with a Yubikey always plugged in).

```

Monitor: LG 27 Inch UltraFine 5k

One of the very few displays that support M1 mac brightness controls with the keyboard.

Control laptop brightness with F1/F2, and control this monitor’s brightness with Ctrl + F1/F2.

Also, the built-in webcam removed my need for an additional Logitech Webcam sitting on top

Mouse: Logitech MX Vertical Mouse

Vertical mice are the only things that prevent my wrists from hurting after days of use.

It has USB-C and doesn’t require use of the dongle; it will connect directly through bluetooth.

Very comfortable and functional.

Keyboard: Satechi Slim X1 Bluetooth

I actually like the apple keyboards, but this adds four additional features that I love: USB-C, dark finish, multi-device support, and a backlight.

Updated Keyboard:

  
Logitech MX Mini

Logitech recently release a smaller version of their MX Keys. This is now my current keyboard.

# Audio

![vanatoo.jpg|300](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a8687cad74cff1e0c22bf3b/1634170826035-T9WXPX6AOUIVUYNTTYAH/vanatoo.jpg)

Speakers: Vanatoo T0

These are seriously awesome speakers. They’re by far the best speakers I own.

Super versatile, and sound excellent. Check out the reviews on youtube to see how much everyone loves these.

I’m glad I didn’t get the AudioEngines or anything else.

Microphone: Elgato Wave: 3 – USB Condenser Microphone

What’s cool about this microphone is that it includes a pop filter and clip-guard.

The only reason I got this is because the microphone built into the LG monitor isn’t great. This allows me to pull the mic closer to me, but isn’t as complicated as other standalone mics where you have to be hyper aware of gain levels and everything else.

It’ll auto adjust the gain if it’s too loud/quiet and allows you to monitor by plugging headphones into the back.

# Lighting

![benq.jpg|300](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a8687cad74cff1e0c22bf3b/1634171727526-22ZSAS1AKW3F57QW04JS/benq.jpg)

BenQ Screenbar

This is specifically not the plus model which has an extra desktop dial, which I didn’t want extra cables or clutter on my desk. Tapping the top is easy enough. And with the auto-dimming, I don’t ever adjust it anyway.

It also allows for hue adjustment to match other lights around you.

Gantri Arpeggio Table Light

Supports newer Hue Bulbs.
